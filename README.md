# NFL-Prediction-Model
Build machine learning models to predict the outcomes of the 2019 playoffs and Super bowl. The intention of this model was to see how accurate we could get and later refine the model to be used in sports betting. 
- Get data from footballdb.com using pd.read_html
- Wrangle data in Microsoft PowerQuery
- Train model on 2012-2019 regular/post seasons. Excluding 2019 post season since that was our testing sample.
- Use Logistic Regression and Random Forest Regressor to predict outcomes of games.
